/*

  The real power of matrices come from matrix composition. When matrices of a a certain class
  are multiplied together they preserve the history of the transformations and are reversible.
  This means that if a translation, rotation, and scale matrix are all combined together,
  when the order of the matrices is reversed, and re-applied then the original points are returned.

  The order that matrices are multiplied in matters. When multiplying numbers a * b = c, and
  b * a = c are both true. For example 3 * 4 = 12, and 4 * 3 = 12. The math term for this is
  that the multiplication of numbers is commutative. Matrices are not guaranteed to be the
  same if the order is switched, so matrices are non-commutative.

  Another mind-bender is that matrix multiplication needs to happen in the reverse order that
  the operations intuitively happens. For instance to scale something down by 80%, move it down
  200 pixels, and then rotate about the origin 90 degrees would look something like this in code:

  transformation = rotate * translate * scale
