/*
  To start, a 3d transformation matrix is a set of 16 values arranged in a 4x4 grid.
  In JavaScript it is easy to represent a matrix as an array. The typical starting
  point is to show the identity matrix. When this matrix is multiplied against another
  point or matrix then the result will be identical.

/*
  Speaking of multiplication, what does this operation look like in a matrix? The easier
  example is to show the multiplication of a single point. You may not that a 3d point
  doesn't quite match up with a 4x4 matrix, so typically a fourth dimension W is added.
  For a typical position setting this value to 1 will make the math work out.

  Notice how the matrix and point line up:

  [ 1, 0, 0, 0,
    0, 1, 0, 0,
    0, 0, 1, 0,
    0, 0, 0, 1 ]

  [ 4, 3, 2, 1]

  Note: The W component eventually has some additional uses that are not explored
  by this content kit.
